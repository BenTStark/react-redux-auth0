# React Redux Auth0 Boilerplate

This boilerplate uses:
* React - for building user interfaces (https://reactjs.org/)
* Redux - handling data flow (https://redux.js.org/)
* Auth0 - for authentication (login, etc.) (https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v11)

It includes also an Endpoint for fetching data from a REST API using Axios (https://github.com/axios/axios)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
